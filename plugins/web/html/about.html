			About December of 2017, Amanda began under the name of another bot. I was very new to coding. At that point, it was just a hobby to take up; Nothing really serious.
			It wasn't until about 2 to 3 months into slow progression, I had started to have somewhat of a grasp of what I was actually doing. By that point, Amanda had taken on two other names and I had already met my current team members who supported me and even hosted for me when I couldn't.
