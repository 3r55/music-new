			About December of 2017, Amanda began under the name of another bot. I was very new to coding. At that point, it was just a hobby to take up; Nothing really serious.
			It wasn't until about 2 to 3 months into slow progression, I had started to have somewhat of a grasp of what I was actually doing. By that point, Amanda had taken on two other names and I had already met my current team members who supported me and even hosted for me when I couldn't.

			I've been developing bots in other node.js libraries since November 2016. At first they were pretty bad, but over the course of a year I evolved into a somewhat decent developer.
			I met Papi in January 2018 and started contributing to Amanda in early April. Pretty much all of Amanda's music- and web-related code was created by me.
